# ðŸª™ Exploring Odo Token: Unveiling the Tokenomics

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where innovation and unique projects are continually emerging, one name has been making waves: Odo Token. This article delves into the details of Odo Token's tokenomics, shedding light on its total supply and allocation.

## **Total Supply: 100,000,000 $ODO**

At the core of any cryptocurrency lies its total supply, a crucial factor that impacts its scarcity and value. In the case of Odo Token, the total supply is capped at 100,000,000 $Odo. This limited supply is a fundamental aspect of Odo Tokenomics, as it ensures that the token remains a finite resource, which can potentially drive up its value over time.

* **Liquidity Provider: 60,000,000 $ODO**

A significant portion of the Odo Token supply, 60,000,000 $Odo, is allocated to liquidity providers. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any trading ecosystem, ensuring that users can buy and sell tokens seamlessly. By dedicating a substantial portion of the tokens to liquidity providers, Odoo Token aims to create a robust and active marketplace where users can trade with confidence.

* **Swap and Staking: 10,000,000 $ODO**

Staking has become a popular method for crypto enthusiasts to earn passive income by locking their tokens and participating in network security. Odo Token recognizes this trend and has allocated 10,000,000 $ODO to swap and staking. This allocation not only incentivizes users to participate in securing the network but also offers them an opportunity to earn rewards in the process.

* **CEX Listing: 20,000,000 $ODO**

Listing on centralized exchanges (CEX) is a crucial step for any cryptocurrency project to gain exposure and accessibility to a broader user base. To facilitate this, Odo Token has earmarked 20,000,000 $Odo for CEX listing. This allocation demonstrates the project's commitment to expanding its reach and ensuring that users can easily access and trade Odo Tokens on popular exchanges.

* **Burn: 10,000,000 $ODO**

Token burning is a deliberate and permanent removal of tokens from circulation, typically done to reduce supply and potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens. In the case of Odo Token, 10,000,000 $Odo has been allocated for burning. This strategic move showcases the project's dedication to maintaining the scarcity of the token and potentially benefiting long-term holders.
